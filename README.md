# Automating Support Document Creation with AI

This project aims to automate the process of creating support documentation, using an **AI cloud-hosted** *Step Recorder* and *Documentation Builder*.

> This project was originally made, to quickly develop visual support guides for non-technical users struggling with text-only instructions.
> 
> The project has since been adapted to function within a hypothetical IT support environment, integrating with **Microsoft 365** for use with *SharePoint Online* and *OneDrive*.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:

- **System:** `Windows 11`
- **Cloud Platform:** `Microsoft 365`
- **Document Management:** `SharePoint` Online, `Confluence`
- **Collaboration:** `OneDrive` for Business
- **Documentation:** `AI-Step Recorder` *(Scribe)*
- **Ticketing:** `Jira` Service Management

# Introduction

The IT department's current system for creating support documentation, has led to several challenges for both our customers and support team members:

**1. The Creation Process** - <ins>labour-intesive and time-consuming</ins> 

> Manually creating support docs is a tedious process, involving multiple steps. From capturing screenshots, to adding annotations, to writing instructions, and arranging everything to create a visaully cohesive and professional-looking user guide.
>
> This long process, led to the Support Team <ins>prioritizing only common support tickets for documentation</ins>, leaving many users without visual support guides for self-troubleshooting.

**2. Content Quality** - <ins>non user-friendly experience</ins>  

> Most of the support docs are written as step-by-step instructions, saved as response templates in our ticketing system. But non-technical users often struggled with these text-only user guides.
>
> The <ins>lack of visual-aids</ins>  to help provide context, led to users being confused and making errors during the process of following these step instructions.

**3. Version Control** - <ins>lack of document maintenance</ins> 

> Keeping PDF support documentation up-to-date became difficult due to its static format, especially for applications that undergo frequent system updates and changes to their User Interface (GUI), requiring user guides to be re-created from scratch.
>
> This resulted in <ins>outdated instructions</ins> that weren't matching the users' screens, leaving them unable to resolve issues independently.
